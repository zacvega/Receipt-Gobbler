process layers
1. validate input
2. load configs
    model, api address, parameters
    load prompt
3. wrap request
4. send request
5. unwrap response

extra classes
1. logger 
    log token estimates and true count
    log costs and accuracy

2. datatypes
    how is date and time laid out in json


Notes
schemas would be better off as txt files where json is just the file names
make wrap and unwrap generic
change how api key is loaded in
